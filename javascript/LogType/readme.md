## LogType 🌶️

1. Create a file named `logType.js`.
2. Declare a variable named `data`.
3. Write a `switch` statement that takes the `typeof data` and logs a different
   string depending on the type/value of `data`.

The string it logs should be one of the following:

- "undefined!"
- "null!"
- "number!"
- "not a number!"
- "string!"
- "boolean!"
- "bigint!"
- "function!"
- "object!"
- "array!"
- "I have no idea!"

> 💡 you will need to google for object and array.

## Development

To run the LogType challenge, there are two main options:

- In VSCode, go to Run -> Run Without Debugging
- From your terminal. Change to the folder where the file is. Then run the
  command `node fileName.js`
