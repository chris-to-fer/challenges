## Calculate Circle Area and Circumference üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

### Steps

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual
   Studio Code).
2. Initialize a variable to represent the radius of a circle. For example, you
   can set radius to a specific value, like 5.
3. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula
   [Math.PI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/PI) \*
   [Math.pow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow)(radius, 2)
   and store the result in a variable called circleArea.
4. Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula 2 _
   [Math.PI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/PI)
   _ radius and store the result in a variable called circumference.
5. Display the results by logging them to the console. You can use console.log
   to print the area and circumference. For example:

   ```md
   For a circle with a radius of 5 units:

   -   The area is approximately 78.54 square units.
   -   The circumference is approximately 31.42 units.
   ```

6. Run your JavaScript program to see the calculated area and circumference of
   the circle with the specified radius.
